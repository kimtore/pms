# PMS
## Practical Music Search
Practical Music Search is an ncurses-based client for
[MPD](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki). It has a command line
interface much like [Vim](http://www.vim.org), and supports custom colors,
layouts, and key bindings. [PMS](https://github.com/ambientsound/pms) aims to
be accessible and highly configurable.
