Practical Music Search is a ncurses-based client for MPD. It has a command line
interface much like Vim, and supports custom colors, layouts, and key bindings.
PMS aims to be accessible and highly configurable.

	1. Compiling
********************

$ ./configure && make && sudo make install

See INSTALL file for detailed instructions.


	2. Requirements
***********************

PMS is a client for the Music Player Daemon (http://musicpd.org). You need to 
have MPD installed and working before using PMS, but not neccessarily on the
same machine.

This client works best with recent MPD versions (>= 0.15.0).

PMS depends on the following libraries:

ncurses (>= 5.0)
glib2 (>= 2.0)
boost_regex (>= 1.36.0) to enable regular expression searches


	3. Configuration
************************

Consult the man page for configuration options.

There are example configuration files in the "examples" directory.

If there is no man page available on your system, you can read the manual page 
online at <http://pms.sourceforge.net/pms.1.html>.

Hint: type ':help' from within PMS to show a list of all current keyboard
bindings.
